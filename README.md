# Foundry

The foundry app (previsouly known as the playlist maker) is used by Rapsodie to push machine-generated playlists on Spotify that can update regularly.

### TODO

- [ ] create doc for playlist that never gets updated

## Design

Foundry is basically just a Google Cloud Function triggered by events sent on a PubSub topic. Each playlist is triggered by a given event which contains all necessary information for the playlist to be created/updated.

The core playlist logic is containted in Foundry within classes in the [auto_playlists](rapsodie/playlist_maker/auto_playlists) directory.

The execution logic is handled in the [entrypoint.py](rapsodie/playlist_maker/entrypoint.py) file.

For example the [RandomTracks.py](rapsodie/playlist_maker/auto_playlists/RandomTracks.py) file defines the `RandomTracks` class with the `get_tracks()` method. This method fetches 10 random track in the db rand returns them. Those tracks are them passed to the `generic()` method that will connect to Spotify and update/create the playlist if needed.

## Run locally

### Virtual env

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Spotify credentials

At the root of the repo run the following commands

```sh
export PYTHONENV=local
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=e109534e11a24370aec072e3c798d41f
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=
export SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=https://localhost:8888
export SPOTIFY_SCOPES="playlist-read-collaborative playlist-modify-public playlist-read-private playlist-modify-private"
python scripts/connect.py -u your_spotify_username
```

This will generate a `.spotify_cache` file at the root of the repo.

### Personal event

To run Foundry locally you should start by defining your own event. It will simulate the kind of event that is sent on Cloud Scheduler to trigger the function in production. You can find a template in the [events](events) directory at the root or the repo.

Here's an example of how to complete it

```
{
    "entrypoint": "diggers", # which playlist is concerned [random, diggers]
    "username": "heus92", # your Spotify user name
    "playlist_name": "", # if it doesn't exist a new playlist will be created
    "playlist_id": "", # your existing playlist id
    "description": "", # playlist description that will appear in Spotify
    "public": "False", # public playlist are visible to anyone
    "playlist_cover": "", # not implemented
    "override": "True", # if False playlist should be empty not to fail
    "push_method": "replace", # [append, replace, keep]
    "append": "True", # not sure why we have this tbh
    "tracks": [], # not implemented
    "credentials": {} # copy .spotify_cache file json
}
```

Make sure to name with the following convention to make sure you're credentials won't be committed: `user-entrypoint-event.json`.

For example Rashad's event for the random playlist will be name `rashad-random-event.json` and production event for the diggers playlist will be `rapsodie-diggers-event.json`

### Go live !

Once you're all set up change the event file to be used in the `rapsodie/playlist_maker/__main__.py` file

```python
event = "rashad-random-event.json"
```

And you can then run the magic command

```sh
python rapsodie/playlist_maker/__main__.py
```

## New playlist

To illustrate this section we'll use the example of a playlist made of 10 random tracks.

1. create a new `RandomTrack.py` file

2. in this file create your playlist class inheriting from `AutoPlaylist`

```python
class RandomTracks(AutoPlaylist):
    ...
```

3. make sure this class implements a `get_tracks()` method.

```python
class RandomTracks(AutoPlaylist):
    def get_tracks(self):
        ...
```

It can take as many arguments as needed.

4. in the `entrypoint.py` file update the `AUTO_PLAYLIST` variable with

```python
AUTO_PLAYLIST = {"generic": None, "random": RandomTracks}
```

5. update your personal event with your new entrypoint, to make a dry run to make sure everything is working as intented.

```sh
python rapsodie/playlist_maker/__main.py
```

6. congrats you've created a new Rapsodie playlist ðŸŽ‰

## Deploy to GCP

After you've created your new playlist, you'd want to make it live for the world to enjoy it!

### Cloud function deployment

If your new playlist requires new environment variables (credentials, global stuff..) update the `.env.yaml` file.

Then, everything is handled. Run:

```sh
./deploy_function.sh
```

The process is quite long and usually takes 2 minutes.

### Trigger the function

Remember that the trigger is how the playlist will be updated. Google Cloud Scheduler will send an event to a Pub/Sub topic on which the function is listening. Each event will trigger a Foundry run.

1. go to [Google Cloud Scheduler](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudscheduler?project=rapsodie) UI.

2. click on `create job`

3. name your job like `update_playlist_yourplaylist`

4. give it a nice and short description

5. to help write the frequency in the cron language you can use [this website](https://crontab.guru/)

6. choose your timezone

7. choose `Pub/Sub` as target

8. write `playlists_update` as topic (it already exists and Foundry is listening there)

9. the payload is the production version of your custom event. basically you update the information to make it match Rapsodie account (username, playlistname, and credentials)
